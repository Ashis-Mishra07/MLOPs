pip install zenml["server"]
zenml --version 

zenml init
zenml downgrade   # to avoid the errors and warnings 

# we will not use csv file rather we will use data that is retrieved from sql database 
# made src folder to contain the datasets
# made pipeline folder , it will contain all the pipeline 
# made saved folder
# made steps folder -> contains the steps folder 

# inside steps 
    made injest_data  to injest all the data inside it 
    made file to clean the data
    made file to train the data
    made file to evaluate the data

# made pipeline

NOTE:
Basically the output after the run will give u tree like structure which is called artifacts .


# The Artifacts means the meta , attributes and visualization of the data that is being shown whne clicked to the pipeline link .

# Enabling cache in the pipeline 
    If there is no code change in the section , then it uses its previous version so that it will load very fast and will not rerender it again .


Then data cleaning is done by adding models in the clean data in src folder and use it in clean data model
