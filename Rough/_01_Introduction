MLOps is a set of practises that aims to delploy and maintain maintain machine 
learning models in production relaibly and efficiently .

The loop for which the MLOps came into picture is :-

Data Collection   ->   Training Model  ->  Deployment in production

After Deployment if assumptions are violated or not following the order or 
the pattern is changed it again go back to the data collection and again repeat
the loop .


Model Centric -> data is fixed , keep on increasing the model
Data Centric  -> model is fixed ,keep on changing the data



PipeLine is basically a high level workflow that organises a series of tasks 
required to create a final product . In the context of a movie , these steps might 
include scriptwriting , casting , filming , editing  and distribution .

Each step involves:
Data Preparation
Feature Engineering
Model Training
Model Evaluation
Model Deployment
